# Bringing Guests to a Party

[Notes only]

* We want to strike a balance between new and 'old' people. We find too
  many new people can upset the atmosphere
* You are responsible for your guest
* Consider their behavior, are you comfortable being held
  responsible for their actions?

## Handling inappropriate behavior

* If your guest behaves inappropriately we will tell *you*, not them. This
  may be during or after the event.
* You may then choose to discuss this with your guest. If you can convince
  both yourself and us that your guest will adjust their behavior then
  they will be welcome to attend a second event
* Further inappropriate behavior will result in your guest no longer being
  welcome.
