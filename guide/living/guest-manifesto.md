# Guest Manifesto

## General

* All partners of housemates and friends of housemates are welcome to stay
  with us at any time, either in rooms or on couches.
* All partners and friends of housemates can stay for as long as they want,
  as often as they want.
* Guests to our parties are always welcome to stay overnight.
* We welcome couch surfers for up to 5 nights.
* We welcome ‘queers in need’ to prevent people being homeless and/or give
  them a supportive queer space to stay for as long as they need.
* Guests who are not in the above categories are also welcome by negotiation
  (eg people between houses/longer term couch surfers) who are staying more
  than a night or two should:
      1. keep the house informed of their plans to stay.
      2. pay the guest rate per night (outlined below).

## Neutral Impacts

* Heating is on at a constant level regardless of number of guests, so the more people who benefit, the better. No impact on gas bill.
* No impact is made by guests on our internet bill.
* Laptops make no difference to electricity bill.
* Water use has no impact on the water bill.

## Non-Neutral Impacts

* Extra showers for guests do have an impact on the gas bill.
* Use of electric heaters, additional use of the kettle and in particular the overhead strip lights in the downstairs make an impact on the electricity bill.
* Extra guests have an impact on the cooking/cleaning/tidying/chores.
* Extra guests have an impact on the emotions of the house.

**Therefore, guests make an impact on:**

* Washing up burden
* Cooking burden
* Keeping the communal areas tidy
* Food/bills costs
* Emotions

## Preferred contributions

* **Washing up**: please do some every day (it has to be done several times a day both upstairs and down)

* **Cooking burden**: feel free to help us cook. Either be a sous-chef for someone or coordinate with a housemate over ingredients to cook a meal. Expect to serve at least 8 people including vegetarian option. However, we each only cook about twice or thrice a week so this is less important.

* **Keep communal areas tidy**: Please keep personal effects stored away. Coats and shoes can be stored by the main entrance. Bigger bags and belongings can be stored on the black shelving rack marked ‘guests’ downstairs in the warehouse. Please put laptops under the lounge table when not in use and keep the sofas clear of clothes/items.

* **Food/bills costs**: Feel free to make a small donation to the house if you are a regular guest. If you are eligible for The Guest Rate (see above) it is £5 per night. This covers your impact on bills and food. If you are paying the guest rate, do not purchase extra food (unless it is just for you), rather co-ordinate with housemates about the weekly food shop. All food is communal, please eat it! If something is exclusively yours: hide it. Guest rate to be paid as promptly as possible to: [please ask us for bank details]

* **Emotions**: Please be aware of your emotional impact on the house. Often
  this is very positive! And we love having guests. However please be aware
  that everyone has differing levels of social energy, including you. People
  often retire to their rooms, please respect their privacy. For this reason
  you should keep your things in a public area of the house. Remember that you
  will need private time too. If you don’t have somewhere private to be as a
  guest, feel free to ask a housemate. We try to keep multiple rooms/spaces
  available for flexible uses and most housemates are happy for their rooms
  to be used as private spaces for guests when they are not in the house.
